This is an evidence-first research system for the [DOE GEMS Prize](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/306/competition-doe-gems/).
The actual target is **surface fault probability**, which can inform geothermal
exploration; a predicted fault is not proof of a geothermal vent or resource. See the
[official problem and metric](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/306/competition-doe-gems/page/967/).

## Independent recheck and historical pruning evidence

A parallel review independently checked the pinned GEMSDOE31/32/36 masks, the
universal witness and the saved H6-1 holdout receipt. The merged recheck surveys the
current local TIFFs and records 20 passing raster/evidence checks, **not** a candidate
approval: [verification](knowledge/verification-2026-10-27.md) ·
[JSON](evidence/verification_2026-10-27.json) ·
[historical HOLDOUT-DTI](evidence/h6_1_proximity_pruning_holdout.json) ·
[three-pass review](knowledge/session-review-merged-2026-10-27.md).
H6-1's buffered holdout excludes the live near-catalogue regime, so it cannot establish
why B2's unreceipted 0.2778 changed. No experiment was rerun in this lane.

## Project prompt and standing instructions — read at the start of every session

The following is the operational project brief, preserving the user's mandatory
requirements and the historical-claim ledger; it is a condensed working record, **not
a verbatim transcript** of the conversation. The prior submissions and all their
owner-reported figures have been retained in [the historical ledger](registry/historical_owner_claims.csv)
(copied from [GEMSDOE33's pinned user-report ledger](https://github.com/buffedlizard55-lab/GEMSDOE33/blob/a24fb7c5031ee08b12440af4593057858fecef8e/registry/user_reported_scores_20261026.csv));
the ledger itself is not independently receipt-verified or guaranteed exhaustive. A peer-preserved
[full historical brief](#peer-preserved-historical-owner-brief) is included below for context;
its original conversation transcript was not independently available here.

### Mission and values

- Review the repo and focus on GEMSDOE24, 25, 27, 28, 30, 31, 32, 33 and 36. Make an
  executive summary with the best known historical file for each site, a defensible
  estimate or an explicit **not estimable**, uniqueness versus the other listed sites,
  and an obvious download/submission decision. Investigate the reported GEMSDOE32
  H33 B2 result and whether a scientifically distinct method can improve on it.
- **Maximize P(Win)** by prioritizing reproducible improvements rather than spending
  scarce uploads on unvalidated guesses. **Own the Outcome** by investigating defects,
  surfacing negative results and maintaining an accurate handoff.
- “MUST GENERATE A UNIQUE TIF SUBMISSION FOR THE COMPETITION. DO NOT COPY A PREVIOUS
  SUBMISSION UNLESS IT'S FOR LEARNING AND EDUCATION.” A technical file, a different
  filename, a different nodata encoding or a perturbation does not establish novelty.
  If mandatory stop rules make the request impossible, say so rather than fabricate a
  result or present an old file as new.
- Produce an easy, one-click download **only for a genuinely new artifact that is
  clearly labeled**; clearly distinguish research-only files from files approved by the
  separate slot selector. No manual geological inspection should be needed for the
  checks. A local format pass is not organizer acceptance or proof of performance.
- Before implementation, document and rank 3–5 new geological hypotheses, specifying
  inputs, transforms, off-catalogue rationale, confounders, novelty and cost. Confirm
  availability and licensing of needed official external data. The top single lane and
  future alternatives are [preregistered here](knowledge/preregistration-2026-10-26.md).
- Use official, trusted sources; maintain citations, a clean, auditable table, and a
  current public feed that reports staleness. Clearly mark limitations and irregularities.
  Work through implementation, review/fixes and a final re-check. No hallucinations.
- Learn from the listed sites but do not assume any unreceipted historical claim is
  organizer-confirmed. Do not label a projection or a local proxy as an actual score.
  Holdout values must include evaluator version, withheld positives and spatial 95% CI;
  organizer-confirmed candidate results require a submission-page receipt tied to bytes.

### Parallel-run protocol — binding unless explicitly revised

1. **LANE:** stay within one assigned method. If surface or final-dot rank correlation
   exceeds 0.90 against any registry raster, or more than 70% of dots are within 3 px
   of one registry raster, log duplicate and stop. Check before placement and on final dots.
2. **REUSE, DON'T REBUILD:** use the template's cached feature stack, `evaluate_holdout.py`
   and `submission_writer.py`. Holdout must hide whole fault segments with a buffer;
   derive catalogue features only from visible faults; mask visible faults pixel-exactly;
   score pooled DTI with α=0.2, β=0.8 and the 300 m triangular kernel. If a shared tool
   is wrong, fix it once upstream, not in a private fork.
3. **LABEL:** every performance number must be HOLDOUT-DTI (version, positive count and
   95% CI) or ORGANIZER-CONFIRMED (actual submission receipt). A projection is not a
   score; unverified owner claims must never be relabeled as either.
4. **LEAKAGE CANARY:** test each feature alone on the holdout. AUC > 0.90 is leakage
   until proven otherwise.
5. **RUN CARD:** output one JSON card with hypothesis, mechanism, named non-fault mimic,
   holdout DTI and CI, registry correlation/overlap, raster SHA-256, validator output,
   submission name and note ≤140 characters, and verdict `promote` or `negative`.
   Negative results are deliverables.
6. **BUDGET:** stop after 3 experiments or 2 hours. Do not select a real submission slot;
   that requires a separate selector step and the current weekly cap on the portal.

The supplied request refers to a “single method paragraph below” but does not identify
one. The [preregistration](knowledge/preregistration-2026-10-26.md) therefore records
one **proposed**, not externally assigned, lane. The universal preflight stop occurs
before that lane is run.

### Competition and submission requirements

- Predict all faults in the GeoDAWN region in one 100 m, single-band float32 GeoTIFF,
  on the sample's CRS, shape and transform; valid predictions are probabilities in
  `[0,1]`. [Official format and DTI](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/306/competition-doe-gems/page/967/).
  The user encountered “Predicted values must be in range [0, 1]”; its cause is not
  proven. The shared writer rejects invalid or nonfinite input rather than silently
  clipping. **Unresolved format risk:** the official text says null/NaN outside bounds,
  while the owner-mirrored sample has NaNs outside its finite footprint and the shared
  writer emits unmasked zeros there. The meaning of “bounds” and portal acceptance are
  not established; reconcile with organizers and fix the shared writer upstream before
  any future upload. See [IR-04](knowledge/review-and-irregularities-2026-10-26.md).
- [Official rules](https://docs.nlr.gov/docs/fy26osti/96647.pdf) state up to three
  submissions per week and require one final choice across both prize rounds, complete
  reproducible solution assets, license compliance, and generative-AI-use disclosure.
  Check the current account's actual quota before any upload. No account or private labels
  are accessible here.
- Focus-site links: [24](https://buffedlizard55-lab.github.io/GEMSDOE24/),
  [25](https://buffedlizard55-lab.github.io/GEMSDOE25/), [27](https://buffedlizard55-lab.github.io/GEMSDOE27/),

  [33](https://buffedlizard55-lab.github.io/GEMSDOE33/), [36](https://buffedlizard55-lab.github.io/GEMSDOE36/docs/).
  Exact pinned research file links and independently computed overlaps are in the
  [dashboard](docs/index.html) and [audit](evidence/focus_audit.json).
- The user supplied multiple historical leaderboard figures; they are time-dependent and
  not a receipt. The public leaderboard is monitored separately and always timestamped.
  Never infer a current private score or an uploaded-file identity from it.

- The user also supplied Dropbox links to the rules, example TIFF, fault TIFF, numerical
  features and DEM link list. Direct Dropbox/DrivenData access is not available from
  this sandbox. The shared template restores a public owner mirror through allowed
  GitHub hosts; SHA pins prove mirror consistency, **not** independent official origin.
  An authenticated organizer download and hidden test labels remain unavailable.

## Results and limitations of this session

- Independently re-read nine pinned historical GeoTIFFs: all fail the requested
  uniqueness rule against at least one other focus-site raster. GEMSDOE25 and GEMSDOE30
  are identical inside the footprint despite different file encodings. See the full
  directional overlap matrix in [focus_audit.json](evidence/focus_audit.json).
- The H33 B2 raster is an exact support subset of an H27-4 base (37,654 vs 40,199
  positive pixels); 2,545 were removed close to mapped faults. This establishes a
  mechanism in the files, **not** a causal reason for the unverified historical claim.
- A registered 17GEMSDOE probability raster is positive on all 5,167,373 mirrored
  footprint cells. Under the template's finite-positive support rule, any nonempty
  in-footprint candidate has 100% forward overlap with that witness. This makes the
  literal rule impossible; no density exemption or undocumented change was applied.
- A parallel branch merged a 35,000-dot step-over TIFF (`5d451566…`). Independent
  rereading shows **98.55%** of all its dots within 3 px of the registered witness,
  **747** dots outside the mirrored footprint, and **463** on the mirrored fault
  catalogue. It is **not unique or cleared** under this protocol. Its 58-file audit
  omitted the witness and its all-valid synthetic grid cannot establish the footprint.
  Two other stand-ins do not match the sample's grid. Their files and original history
  are preserved; see [concurrent artifact audit](evidence/concurrent_audit.json).
- The shared template and 19 feature-band caches were restored with pinned SHA-256s.
  They are in ignored `.cache/`, not Git. The shared uniqueness tool tests positive
  correlation only, while the requested threshold is `|rho| > 0.90`; the independent
  audit uses the two-sided rule, and an upstream fix is still needed. No new AUC canary,
  valid holdout, raster or local new-file validator result exists because the stop came
  first. See the [scientific review](knowledge/scientific-review-2026-10-26.md) and
  [irregularities and next steps](knowledge/review-and-irregularities-2026-10-26.md).

## Reproduce the autonomous audit

Requires Python 3.11+, internet to GitHub/PyPI, `gh` or unauthenticated GitHub API
access, and disk space for the cached 19-band mirror. The script creates `.venv` if
needed and calls the pinned shared template without forking its evaluator/writer:

```bash
bash scripts/restore_shared_data.sh   # restore template + public mirror + 19 cached bands
.venv/bin/python scripts/audit_focus.py      # proof, nine-site comparison, negative run card
.venv/bin/python scripts/audit_concurrent.py # recheck parallel artifacts and rebind card
.venv/bin/python scripts/audit_archive.py    # inspect archived LST1 bytes, no new TIFF
.venv/bin/python scripts/audit_peer_releases.py # inspect two featured peer files
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q               # synthetic and evidence checks
python scripts/build_site.py && python scripts/check_site.py
python -m http.server 8000 --bind 0.0.0.0 --directory docs
```

The static [GitHub Pages dashboard](https://wingbangboozle1-lang.github.io/WBGGEMSDOE3/)
is built from the evidence. Its scheduled workflow refreshes the public leaderboard
observation using the official public HTMX table fragment; failed refreshes retain a visibly stale snapshot. It also checks each of the nine source repository HEADs on the Pages schedule and marks individual failures or age as stale. A changed HEAD is not proof that a particular file or score changed. A feed
cannot reveal account quota, private labels, actual uploaded bytes or selector approval.
The repository currently also has legacy branch-based Pages enabled; the scheduled
workflow stages the same `/docs/` URL layout to avoid broken links when both publish.
Official source descriptions and unresolved timing/format details are recorded in [source notes](knowledge/source-notes-2026-10-27.md). The integration could not change the Pages source setting (GitHub returned 403); both
publishers were observed to deploy successfully. The source and checks are in
`.github/workflows/` and `scripts/refresh_feed.py`.

**Next session:** resolve the registry-support contradiction through an explicit
protocol revision; then verify official data provenance and band semantics, freeze the
single lane and comparator inventory, run feature canaries and buffered whole-segment
holdout against a matched same-evaluator incumbent, and only then use the unchanged
shared writer and separate selector. The current instruction makes producing an
eligible unique TIFF impossible, so the project must not imply otherwise.

## Historical LST1 lane — research only, not unique

The [LST1 archive notice](LST1_README.md) and [byte audit](evidence/archive_audit.json)
supersede the former readiness assertions. Both saved TIFFs contain 32,810 positive
in-footprint cells and overlap a registered witness on **100%** of them. They fail the
literal >70% stop; earlier lattice exemptions were unauthorized. A local all-finite
format diagnostic is **not** portal acceptance. The former “independent verifier PASS”
is retired, as are the generation and finalization entry points that used those rules.

The historical output labelled HOLDOUT-DTI (evaluator GEMSDOE32-HIDE-RECOVER-v3.0,
22,232 withheld positives) recorded candidate 0.06668 [0.05688, 0.07655] and proxy
0.09920 [0.08595, 0.11267], paired Δ −0.03252 [−0.04103, −0.02372] (reported spatial
95% CIs). These numbers are **not independently established as protocol-compliant**:
the runner uses fixed H19-5/D2.8 rasters and bins/canaries constructed using the full
catalogue; the raster's original training may also have seen withheld labels. Treat the
results as historical research, not valid promotion evidence or a leaderboard estimate.
The [old card](evidence/lst1_run_card.json) is explicitly superseded; the only current
run card is [evidence/run_card.json](evidence/run_card.json).

## Peer-preserved historical owner brief

The following collapsible record is copied from the [pinned GEMSDOE36 historical owner brief](https://github.com/buffedlizard55-lab/GEMSDOE36/blob/7576942352382c557f074bae3f2c6eb72750fa44/knowledge/owner_brief_2026-10-25.md) (SHA-256 `b7baacd65813672ca127efb470f0e2f1043fd26a4954466e747765c59ed846c3`). It is a peer's preserved text with normalized links, not an independently verified transcript of this conversation. Historical scores, file recommendations, portal text (including ZIP acceptance), and claims about data placement are context, **not independently verified current facts or submission approval**. The current instructions and negative decision above take precedence.

# Owner brief — 2026-10-25

The following preserves the current user brief (link markup normalized; the Arena branch-status wrapper is omitted). Read this and the latest README decision at the beginning of every session. Historical claims inside are requirements/context, not independently verified scores. This current brief supersedes historical requests to submit copied/thinned reference rasters or to seek a human inspection exception.

---

Review the repo.

I want to focus on the highest scoring submissions from the following sites, GEMSDOE24, GEMSDOE25, GEMSDOE27, GEMSDOE28, GEMSDOE30, GEMSDOE31, GEMSDOE32, GEMSDOE33, GEMSDOE36. I want an executive summary on every site that is clear and obvious which is the best submission to submit to obtain a high score on the leaderboard. It should also be unique and not an exact duplicate of any previous submission that is the same as below.

We should be able to estimate the score for a submission. I want a table in the executive summary that clearly lists what file to download, what the estimate score is, and whether it is a unique submission unlike any of the other GEMDOE sites listed below.

THE FOLLOWING IS THE HIGHEST URGENCY AND MUST BE FOLLOWED!

MUST GENERATE A UNIQUE TIF SUBMISSION FOR THE COMPETITION. DO NOT COPY A PREVIOUS SUBMISSION UNLESS IT'S FOR LEARNING AND EDUCATION. BUT WE MUST GENERATE A UNIQUE TIF SUBMISSION. IT MUST BE OBVIOUS WHETHER IT IS OK TO DOWNLOAD AND SUBMIT THE GENERATED TIF SUBMISSION.

There should be an easy to download submission tif file as described by the prompt. Read the entire prompt. A lot of sites mention inspection only and a human inspector, but the inspection needs to be done through the project and needs to be validated for submission without human intervention.

PARALLEL-RUN PROTOCOL — read first. This session is one of several running from this same prompt.

1. LANE. Your lane is the single method paragraph below. Stay inside it. If your raster's rank-correlation with any registry raster exceeds [0.90], or more than [70%] of your dots fall within 3 px of one registry raster's dots, you have drifted into another lane: log it as a duplicate and stop. Check this on the surface before placement AND on the final dots.

2. REUSE, DON'T REBUILD. Use the template's cached feature stack, evaluate_holdout.py and submission_writer.py. Holdout = hide-and-recover: withhold whole fault segments with a buffer, derive every catalogue-based feature only from the visible faults, mask visible faults pixel-exactly, score pooled DTI (alpha 0.2, beta 0.8, 300 m triangular kernel). If a shared tool is wrong, fix it once in the template and report it; never keep a private fork.

3. LABEL EVERY NUMBER as HOLDOUT-DTI (evaluator version, number of withheld positives, 95% CI) or ORGANIZER-CONFIRMED (copied from a submission-page receipt). A projection is never written as a score.

4. LEAKAGE CANARY. Test each feature alone on the holdout before trusting any result. AUC above [0.90] means leakage until proven otherwise.

5. RUN CARD. End with one JSON card: hypothesis; mechanism; the named non-fault process that could mimic it; holdout DTI + CI; correlation/overlap vs registry; raster sha256; validator output (no NaN inside the footprint, values in [0,1], CRS/shape/transform match); submission name + note of at most 140 characters; verdict promote / negative. Negative results are deliverables.

6. BUDGET. Stop after [3] experiments or [2] hours. Do not pick submissions: promotion to a real slot is a separate selector step, within the weekly cap shown on the submission page.

The following sites should serve as a starting point for understanding how to generate TIF submissions. These websites are researched, and tested and have generated TIF submissions. But we need to generate high scoring submissions.

Here are the results from submissions into the competition, separated by ....:

WE NEED TO STUDY, ANALYZE, AND UNDERSTAND THE HIGHEST SCORE FROM THE GEMDOE SITE WHERE THE SUBMISSION TIF IS DOWNLOADED FROM WHICH IS THE FOLLOWING:

I think it makes sense that in order for a submission to be validated that it needs to pass certain high scoring validation gates before confirming whether a file is unique and can be submitted for scoring.

The following is the leaderboard for the competition:

https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/306/competition-doe-gems/leaderboard/

See below for more links and information related to the competition:

https://github.com/drivendataorg/gems-prize-reference-solution

https://gbcge.org/current-projects/ingenious/

https://epsg.io/32611

We need to quickly look at the results and results from the GEMSDOE websites above.

Before implementing, generate 3–5 candidate geological hypotheses we haven't tried yet, each naming: the specific layer(s) involved, the physical signature being targeted (e.g., an edge-detection or curvature transform), why it should catch a fault missing from the USGS/INGENIOUS catalogue rather than one already in it, and how it differs from anything already implemented in this repo. Rank them by expected DTI improvement and implementation cost. Validate the top candidate on our spatially-blocked holdout set before touching a weekly submission slot — do not spend a submission slot on an idea that hasn't beaten the current holdout best. If a candidate can't be validated without new external data, name the specific free, official source needed and check it's obtainable before proposing the idea as viable.

Work line by line verifying from official verified trusted sources, provide links for manual review. There should be no manual input, work on your own to complete tasks. Flag any irregularities for review. No hallucinations.

Verify no hallucinations.

The goal of this project is to get a full list that follow our requirements. No hallucinations. Verify line by line.

We have a good understanding of how our hypothesis, methodology, calculations, analysis are done so we should be able to figure out a way to score higher on the leaderboard using previous results and scoring that we have across the sites listed above. We need to come up with distinct and unique strategies to score higher in this competition leaderboard. We need to start doing heavy and deep research into the part of the project that matters the most, which is the scientific discovery of geothermal vents. We should store all of our information and knowledge that we can gather from official verified sources. This will serve as a starting point for other projects as well. We need to think outside the box but still be grounded in proper scientific research, we are ultimately aiming for a top prize that many others are competing for. So it's important to be contrarian but be smart about it. We need to find sources of data that others are over looking or areas of the project when it comes to geothermal vents. We need to do deep research and critical thinking and come up with new hypothesis to test.

0.3195 is the highest score right now so we need to design a new strategy, research, testing, analyzing, and generating submission system than the current website. It should be unique, take unique approaches to generating a submission that can score higher than 0.3195.

Put this prompt into the repo readme and read it everytime we work on the project as a starting point to make sure we are building what we are aiming for and have a strong base to continue building and improving on making something useful for everyday use. It should solve the problem of having to manually check everything ourselves and having an up to date current feed.

Review the repo.

The following is taken from the Arena AI team and I think it makes a good point on building a successful project, so let's keep the Core Values and Own the Outcome as a focal point when building, developing, researching, suggesting upgrades, and implementing the work.

Our Core Values

Maximize P(Win)

“Maximize the Probability of Winning”: our decision making framework. In every decision, we weigh tradeoffs, assess risk, and choose the path that maximizes the probability that Arena succeeds. We set aside our emotions and make tough decisions in order to maximize P(Win). “Maximize P(Win)” frees us from constraints and clarifies that we must put Arena first.

Own the Outcome

We own results end to end — not just our individual slice of the work. When problems arise and we have the means to act, we do so without waiting for permission or assignment. We treat failure and success as signals and use them to improve. At Arena, we stay accountable to the final outcome.

Work line by line verifying from official verified trusted sources, provide links for manual review. There should be no manual input, work on your own to complete tasks. Flag any irregularities for review. No hallucinations.

Verify no hallucinations.

The goal of this project is to get a full list that follow our requirements. No hallucinations. Verify line by line.

We need to focus on being able to generate a submission into the competition.

The site should be able to generate a TIF file that is required for submission. It should be as easy as download to click a File to submit into the competition. This needs to be in the executive summary or the very beginning of the site. it should be obvious when you visit the site.

I tried to submit the document that i downloaded from the site but it returned this error on the submission form:

"Predicted values must be in range [0, 1]"

Also we need to give it a unique name and A short comment to help you or your team tell submissions apart later e.g. clustering with k=25

Here is the submission page when i click submit file

New submission

File to submitNo file chosen

You can submit a single-band GeoTIFF (.tif) file, or a .zip file containing a single GeoTIFF, with your predictions. It must match the submission format's CRS, shape, and geotransform. You may wish to review the competition rules first.

Note (optional)

A short comment to help you or your team tell submissions apart later e.g. clustering with k=25

Create a executive summary subpage that explains exactly how to make a submission into the contest.

Work on the next steps from the previous sessions first.

The goal of this project is to place top of the leaderboard in this competition. The following is the competition:

https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/306/competition-doe-gems/page/967/

We need to create a project that can compete and place top of the leaderboard. We need to understand the problem, collect all the data and organize it into a clean easily auditable table with official verified links for manual verification.

This is the guidelines we need to follow. https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/306/competition-doe-gems/

Get familiar with the problem through the overview and problem description, https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/306/competition-doe-gems/page/967/. You might also want to reference additional resources available on the about page, https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/306/competition-doe-gems/page/968/.

Download the data from the data, https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/306/competition-doe-gems/data/, tab.

Create and train your own model. This reference solution, https://github.com/drivendataorg/gems-prize-reference-solution implements a simple approach.

Use your model to generate predictions that match the submission format.

Tell me what are you limitations and what you need access to during this project. We will need to find free publicly available sources and data from official and verified sources if we are to use 3rd party or external data.

this pdf outlines how submissions must be entered into the competition.

https://docs.nlr.gov/docs/fy26osti/96647.pdf

You must be able to do your own research, deep research, scientific literature research and organize the knowledge so that we can critically think through the problem and generate a solution through scientific and free publicly available information. this must be done autonomously and must be constantly reviewed and improved upon. Provide suggestions and improvements and implement them.

Verify no hallucinations.

The goal of this project is to get a full list that follow our requirements. No hallucinations. Verify line by line.

Site creation

Create a github page for this repo that has clean ui, user friendly, simple and easy to use. It should be organized and clean.

It should include all relevant information in an easy to read format with official verified links as sources for review. Work line by line verify everything no hallucinations.

**The single remaining blocker to training is data placement**: run `bash scripts/download_competition_data.sh` on any unrestricted machine into `data/`, then `python scripts/prepare_data.py` — after that the full train→inference→validate pipeline is ready to run (GPU needed for training; metric/losses/validation all verified working here on CPU).

you need to complete the above task by yourself. Work line by line verifying from official verified trusted sources, provide links for manual review. There should be no manual input, work on your own to complete tasks. Flag any irregularities for review. No hallucinations.

Run this task through multiple passes.

Pass 1: Implement the task completely and verify the result.

Pass 2: Review your work for bugs, missing requirements, incorrect assumptions, and edge cases. Fix everything you find.

Pass 3: Re-check the entire implementation against the original request. Improve accuracy, reliability, completeness, and code quality. Fix any remaining issues.

Do not stop after the first pass. Each pass must build on the previous one. Before finishing, verify that the final result fully satisfies the original request. Work line by line verify everything no hallucinations.

Go ahead and create a pull request and then merge the pull request onto the main. Make suggestions for what work still needs to be done and any limitations that is in the way of a successful project. It should be worked on in this next session or the next session. Work line by line verify everything no hallucinations.
